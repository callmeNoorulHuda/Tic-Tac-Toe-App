## Game Logic Highlights

### Computer AI (Minimax Algorithm)
The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves:
```dart
int minimax(List<String> board, int depth, bool isMaximizing) {
  // Implementation details...
}
```

### State Management
Game state is managed using `ChangeNotifier`:
```dart
class ComputerGameProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  // Game state variables
  void tapSquare(int index) {
    // Handle player moves
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

## Folder Structure

â””â”€â”€ providers/
    â”œâ”€â”€ computer_game_provider.dart  # Game logic
